    "# Bootstrap\n",

    "The bootstrap is an alternative to the NHST framework already discussed. The primary benefit of the bootstrap is that it comes with fewer assumptions then the NHST framework. The only real assumption when doing a bootstrap approach is that the sample is obtained randomly from the population, an assumption already made in the NHST framework. The primary drawback of the bootstrap approach is that it is computationally expensive, therefore, it can take time to peform the procedure. \n",

    "## Bootstrapping Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the steps when performing a bootstrap. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Treat the sample data as the population.\n",
    "2. Resample, with replacement, from the sample data, ensuring the new sample is the same size as the original. \n",
    "3. Estimate the model using the resampled data from step 2. \n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 many many times (eg, 10,000 or more). \n",
