    "This week will dive into linear regression, the foundation of this course. The exploration into linear regression will first start with the case when we have 2 **continuous** predictors or attributes. We may write this general model as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Where $Y$ is the outcome attribute. It is also known as the dependent variable. The $X$ term is the predictor/covariate attribute. It is also known as the independent variable. The $\\epsilon$ is a random error term, more on this later. Finally, $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$ are unknown population coefficients that we are interested in estimating. More on this later too. \n",

    "Suppose we are interested in exploring if players tend to score more points by playing more minutes in the season. That is, those that play more may have more opportunities to score more points. More generally, the relationship between average points in each game by the total minutes played across the season. \n",

As both of these attributes are continuous ratio type attributes, a scatterplot would be one way to visualize this. A scatterplot takes each X,Y pair of data and plots those coordinates.
